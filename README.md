Description
------
This project is the "Abschlussproject" for my DBS AP at the University Duesseldorf, Germany.

I build this project in MVC pattern, some basic modules were learned from the following tutorials.

I only use Foundation CSS to help me git rid of designing html layout.


MVC
------
MVC is a design pattern. A Design pattern is a code structure that allows for common coding frameworks to be replicated quickly. You might think of a design pattern as a skeleton or framework on which your application will be built.

In the MVC framework that is created in this tutorial, several key points will be raised. The first is the frameworks needs a single point of entry, ie: index.php. This is where all access to the site must be controlled from. To ensure that a single point of entry is maintained, htaccess can be utilized to ensure no other file may be accessed, and that we hide the index.php file in the url. Thus creating SEO and user friendly URL's.
